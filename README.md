# eGFR_Regression_XGBoost
Given 17 months of 100,000 patients’ eGFR scores and demographic data we will leverage gradient boosted trees regression and expanded grid search to predict with a high degree of accuracy, by the metric R-squared, those patients’ 18th-month eGFR scores. 

Note: Dataset is not publicly available, since it is owned by Allscripts EMR. That being said, this repo focuses more on the XGBoost method, feature selection, along with Grid search for parameter tuning
